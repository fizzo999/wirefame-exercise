### how did it go ?

it went really well.

This is my first project that I have been timing myself from the start:

15min to read instructions and draw wire frame on paper;

15min to create a new repo, clone it down to my local machine, fork it AND create the main html scaffold (thank you EMMET);

30min to style navbar and the top half including the top image;

1hour 15min to finish styling the elements - got stuck with trying to clear the float at bottom in order to create the gutter above the footer;

ask for help w TA - 15min - together finding the solution (.clear)Â 

2.75 hours total - great feeling being in charge of my time
